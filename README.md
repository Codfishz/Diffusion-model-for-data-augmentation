# Diffusion-model-for-data-augmentation
For biological research, sample size imbalance is common due to the nature of the research subjects. For example, in the study of the cell cycle phase, the sample size of dividing cells is also much smaller due to the extremely short duration of the mitotic phase compared to the interphase. Data augmentation using image generative models is an excellent way to address insufficient sample size and imbalanced distribution. In addition to the GAN-like models that have been extensively applied, the diffusion model, as an emerging model, has shown extraordinary performance in the field of image generation. This experiment uses the diffusion model as a means of image data enhancement. The experimental results expose that the performance of the classifier with data augmentation is significantly improved compared with the original dataset, and the positive predictive value is increased from about 0.7 to more than 0.9. The results reveal that the diffusion model has a good application prospect in the area of data enhancement and can effectively solve the problem of insufficient data or unbalanced sample size.
